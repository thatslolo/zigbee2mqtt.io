## Options
*[How to use device type specific configuration](../guide/configuration/devices-groups.md#specific-device-options)*

* `illuminance_lux_calibration`: Calibrates the illuminance_lux value (percentual offset), takes into effect on next report of device. The value must be a number.


## Exposes

### Illuminance (lux) (numeric)
Measured illuminance in lux.
Value can be found in the published state on the `illuminance_lux` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `lx`.

### Presence (binary)
Indicates whether the device detected presence.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
If value equals `true` presence is ON, if `false` OFF.

### Presence state (enum)
Presence state.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence_state` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The possible values are: `none`, `present`, `moving`.

### Target distance (numeric)
Min detection distance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `target_distance` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The unit of this value is `m`.

### Motion sensitivity (numeric)
Motion sensitivity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `motion_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"motion_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `10`.

### Detection distance max (numeric)
Max detection distance.
Value can be found in the published state on the `detection_distance_max` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"detection_distance_max": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1.5` and the maximum value is `5.5`.
The unit of this value is `m`.

### Fading time (numeric)
Delay time.
Value can be found in the published state on the `fading_time` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"fading_time": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `1500`.
The unit of this value is `s`.

### Presence sensitivity (numeric)
Presence sensitivity.
Value can be found in the published state on the `presence_sensitivity` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) this value.
To write (`/set`) a value publish a message to topic `zigbee2mqtt/FRIENDLY_NAME/set` with payload `{"presence_sensitivity": NEW_VALUE}`.
The minimal value is `1` and the maximum value is `10`.

### Linkquality (numeric)
Link quality (signal strength).
Value can be found in the published state on the `linkquality` property.
It's not possible to read (`/get`) or write (`/set`) this value.
The minimal value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`.
The unit of this value is `lqi`.
